   	<h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Chua Ming Hwee, a passionate learner currently diving into web development. I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build beautiful and functional websites.</p>
		<p>I enjoy creating small projects to improve my skills everday. I’ve built several projects, including personal portfolios, rock-paper-scissors game, and a personal finance tracker. Through these, I’ve honed my problem-solving and design skills.</p>
		<p>I'm excited to grow as a developer and bring ideas to life through code. When I'm not coding, I enjoy drawing and gaming.</p>
		<p>I would love you to check out the <a href="#projects">projects</a> I've built so far.</p>
